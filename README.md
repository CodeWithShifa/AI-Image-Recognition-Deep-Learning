# AI-Image-Recognition-Deep-Learning
A Deep Learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify images of dogs and cats using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
# 🐕 AI Image Classifier (Dogs vs Cats) 🐈

This project is an entry into the world of **Computer Vision**. Using Deep Learning, I trained a model that can look at an image and distinguish whether it contains a dog or a cat.

## 🧠 How it Works (The Tech Behind It)
Unlike simple linear regression, this project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. 
- **Convolution Layers:** These layers act as filters that detect edges, shapes, and patterns in the photos.
- **Pooling Layers:** These reduce the size of the image data while keeping the most important features.
- **Dense Layers:** These make the final decision (Dog or Cat).



## 🛠️ Key Features
* **Image Preprocessing:** Resizing all images to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 or 128x128).
* **Deep Learning Framework:** Built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.
* **Model Export:** The trained brain of the AI is saved as a `.h5` or `.keras` file for future use.

## 📁 Repository Content
* `cat_dog_ai.py`: The Python script for training/testing.
* `model_weights.h5`: The saved pre-trained model.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **Python**
* **TensorFlow / Keras**
* **NumPy** (for image array processing)
